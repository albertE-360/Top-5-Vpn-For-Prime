# Top-5-Vpn-For-Prime
The Prime VPN service is a product that offers protection for your privacy and security.  It provides you with the ability to browse anonymously, unblock websites or even access banned content from other countries. 

This is one of my favourite services because it brings me peace of mind knowing I have encryption on all my devices, protecting me from hackers when using public WiFi. With this service, I also get the opportunity to unblock sites that are not available in my country which gives me more freedom online! If you're looking for a safe way to surf the web then this service is perfect for you! The only downside? There's no free trial so be sure before committing to see if it's worth your money!   Here are some other great VPN services you can check out:

It's very reliable and fast, making it perfect to stream movies or even play online video games.

This is another great VPN that offers incredible speeds, security and privacy. It keeps zero logs which are perfect because I don't want my ISP snooping on me! The only downside is it's not free so be sure to take advantage of their 7-day money-back guarantee in case you're not satisfied. 

## TorguardVPN.com
I'm a big fan of this service because it offers great speeds and security! They have tons of servers to choose from and an easy to use a client that lets you customize your preferences including protocol type, port selection and more. They are also one of the few VPNs that allow P2P torrenting so you can download without worrying! The only downside is that they don't offer a free trial and they have a 1GB per month cap on bandwidth which could make streaming difficult if you're trying to watch HD video. 

## ExpressVPN.com
Express VPN is one of the best on the market, offering an easy-to-use client and a 30-day money-back guarantee. They have servers in over 90 different countries which makes them perfect for accessing geo-restricted content from anywhere! When downloading torrents, they are one of the few services that don't throttle your speed or attempt to download from different users to keep the torrent alive. The only downside is that they are slightly more expensive than other options, but you get what you pay for with this service!

## PureVPN.com
Last but not least is Pure VPN which also offers a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're looking for an easy way to stay secure and anonymous online. They have servers in over 140 different countries which is awesome for accessing geo-restricted content around the world.
